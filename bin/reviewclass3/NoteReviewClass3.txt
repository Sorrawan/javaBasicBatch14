Logical Operators:
	Logical operators help us test more than one condition. In java we have &&
	as the And operator and || OR operator and ! NOT.
	
Why we should learn Logical Operators?
	Logical operators help us reduce the number of if-conditions that we write in
	certain cases.
What is the syntax?
	if(condition1 && condition2){
	sout"Hello";
	}
	
	if(condition1){
		if(condition2){
	sout"Hello";
	}
	}
	
Switch case:
	similar to if else if conditions.
	
Why we should learn about the switch case?
1)its cleaner code
2) its faster than if conditions.
